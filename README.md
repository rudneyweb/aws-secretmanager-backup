# Secret Manager Password Backup Script
This Python script performs the backup of passwords stored in the Secret Manager. It is essential to ensure the correct usage of environment variables to avoid any connection issues with your account.

The Secret Manager is a critical tool for safeguarding sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and access tokens. By backing up these secrets, you ensure the preservation of data in case of accidental loss or the need for restoration.

Before running the script, make sure you have installed the 'boto3' library, which is necessary to interact with the AWS Secret Manager. Additionally, ensure that your AWS credentials are correctly configured, as access to the secrets is restricted and requires proper authentication.

The script will list all available secrets in the Secret Manager and save them individually in text files. Each file will contain the corresponding secret value.

Remember that it is crucial to maintain the security of the information stored in your Secret Manager and restrict access to these backups only to authorized users. With due caution, you can rely on a robust solution for managing and protecting sensitive passwords.
